Python, REST API, OAuth 2.0, Google SDM API, CSV, Automation

Developed a Python application to interface with Google Nest thermostats using the Smart Device Management (SDM) API.

Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication to securely access and control thermostat devices.

Automated periodic data collection (every 20 seconds for 5 minutes) of thermostat attributes including ambient temperature, humidity, HVAC status, and eco modes.

Converted and stored data in structured CSV files for monitoring and further analysis.

Designed functions to remotely set thermostat modes (HEAT, COOL, HEATCOOL) and temperature setpoints based on user-defined CSV input.

Created utility functions for unit conversion (Celsius â†” Fahrenheit), file I/O, and API communication.

Enabled remote control and real-time logging to support smart home automation and energy optimization efforts.
